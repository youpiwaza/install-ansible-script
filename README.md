## Resources

Based on zsh installation cookbook [script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viasite-ansible/ansible-role-zsh/master/install.sh), from [ansible galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/viasite-ansible/zsh).

Updated following the [official ansible documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#latest-releases-via-apt-ubuntu), created on early 2020. Might be obsolete at some point, check the documentation first ;)
